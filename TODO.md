Light novels on Kindle Unlimited (self.LightNovels)
Hey everyone, I'm not a subscriber to the service yet but I was considering it because I'm getting through so many books... before I do, does anyone know if there's any/many light novels on there or if I should just stick to hard copies?

Thanks in advance!!!

 FIXED:
 ## bottom refetch link doesnt work
 ## https://archiveofourown.org
 ## Clear smartquote bullshit on triggers 
 ## text/plain mimetype freaking shit out
 ## http://10.1.1.8:5000/series-id/3187/ < HR not wrapping.
 ## - If series have > 5 chapters and < 20% of chapters have no numbering, do basic chronological numbering.
 ## - wattpad requires login for some things?
 ## - Show two digits for all fragment numbers.
 ## - Add last updated field for most recent release
 ## - Removing items does not work.
 ## - WattPad metadata filter.
 ## - Rule-caching is not working.
 ## - Multithreaded server fails because DB interface is shared across threads.
 ## - Validate unmatched keys in rules so that key-typos don't silently break things.
 ## - funky tables outlines
 ## - Add Tumblr/Livejournal support already!
 ## "A Wild Last Boss Appeared" it has 3 chapters translated on Oniichanyamete.
